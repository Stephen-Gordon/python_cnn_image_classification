## Image Classification
Building an image classification CNN using Keras, and the CIFAR-10 dataset.
The benchmark model was 70% accuracy.
Managed to increase the accuracy up to 80%.

## Key Takeaways
- start with changing the dropout layers
- look at the VGG architecture
- only use dropout and augmentation to stop overfitting
