## Image Classification
Building an image classification CNN using Keras, and the CIFAR-10 dataset. The benchmark model was 70% accuracy. Managed to increase the accuracy up to 80%.

## Key Takeaways
- Start with changing the dropout layers
- Look at the VGG architecture
- Use dropout and augmentation layers to stop overfitting
